# Overview of ANSYS and ANSYS Workbench
## ANSYS
Ansys software provides Engineering Simulation Solution in various engineering disciplines including: Fluid mechanics, heat transfer, statics, and mechanics. The software is however best known for its Finite Element Analysis as a modelling and simulation tool. 

## Ansys Workbench
Ansys Workbench is a an environment that binds all of its solvers together allowing for an array of simulations to be done under one project. It tracks dependencies among the various types of data in the project. If something changes in an upstream cell, the project schematic shows that downstream cells need to be updated to reflect these changes.

Some of ANSYS solvers include:
- Static Structural 
- Fluid flow (fluent)
- Modal
- Transient Structural
