Consider a **simply supported beam** subjected udl and point load as shown in the diagram. The length of the beam is **6m** and the value of the udl if **5KN/m**. We're required to:
1. Determine the reactions at the supports
2. Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams
3. Determine location and magnitude of the maximum bending moment.

### **ANSYS Simulation**
#### 1. Preprocessing
1.  Material selection and Geometry creation. The geometry is of  **line body** with square cross-section of legth **200m** . The line body is used when the width and height are much less compared to the legnth of a body and they do not change along the entire length of the body. The goal is to reduce the number of nodes and hence reduce the simulation time.
